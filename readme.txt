Lightweight GTD for the P2 WordPress theme.

== Description ==

P2 Resolved Posts is a lightweight GTD plugin for WordPress and the P2 theme. Mark a thread as "unresolved" when there's something needing to be finished, and mark it as "resolved" when it's been finished. Sidebar widgets allow you to see all unresolved posts, optionally filtered to a specific tag.

P2 is a great tool for communication and collaboration. P2 Resolved Posts makes it easier to better understand when a discussion has reached completion.

We're happy to receive feedback, questions, feature suggestions, and [pull requests](https://github.com/Automattic/P2-Resolved-Posts)

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install this plugin is to go to Add New in the Plugins section of your blog admin and search for "P2 Resolved Posts." On the far right side of the search results, click "Install."

You'll need to be running the P2 theme for any interface elements to appear.

If the automatic process above fails, follow these simple steps to do a manual install:

1. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy the merits of GTD in your P2!
